    My research interests lie primarily in reinforcement learning and I look forward to diving deeper into different aspects of the field. 
    I have been a TA for CMPUT 274 and 275. These are honours introductory courses where students learn about C++ and a variety of CS concepts 
    by working with arduinos.
