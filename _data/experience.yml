    As a Search and Data Mining engineer, I worked with a variety of technologies to help improve the relevance of Yelp's search results.
    I used Python, Jupyter notebooks, and SQL to perform data analysis and train learning-to-rank models, while I worked in Java to deploy
    models and new search features into production. 

    During my time as an intern, I worked on a project to test a new method of ordering reviews on business pages on Yelp's iOS app. 
    I oversaw the backend portion of the project and worked in Python to pull the ML model used to order the reviews from a Cassandra database, 
    while retrieving review data from a SQL database and provide results to the client.

    At Optigo Networks, I worked on a variety of improvements to a customer facing web application build using Javascript and Meteor.js.
    I integrated a customer billing and subscription system into the app using the Stripe API and queried customer information from MongoDB.
    As well, I developed visualizations which allowed users to examine BACnet data queried from InfluxDB. Finally, 
    I improved application security by re-implementing the process of uploading and storing files to AWS from the application.

    While working as a co-op student at SAP I designed and executed test plans for a feature which allowed users to import data
    from Hadoop to the SAP Lumira product. I also worked to automate some tests by checking expected HiveQL queries against 
    programmatically generated queries.
